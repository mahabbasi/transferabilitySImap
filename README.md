# Analysis Workflow for the transferability of the random forest model to estimate streamflow intermittence to other regions at the continental scale

This repository contains the code and resources used to conduct the analysis for the paper:  
**"[Towards global modelling of dynamic streamflow intermittence: Transferability of a continental random forest model to other regions]"**

## **Overview**
This repository outlines the analytical workflow and methods used in the paper, providing a step-by-step framework for reproducing all results. It contains scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, statistical modelling, and visualization. In this paper, we evaluated the possibility of a random forest model transferability to other regions for estimating streamflow intermittence by defining nine model variants in Europe and South America. The paper has been submitted to the Hydrology and Earth System Science (EGU) journal. The final products and the shapefiles are accessible at the repository {}.
